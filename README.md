# Command Line Chess

## Overview

For my first coding project, I decided to keep things simple and recreate the game of chess. This version is playable on the command line with 2 human players. This project helped solidify my understanding of inheritance, abstract classes, enums, exception handling, user inputs, and git.

## Instructions
To play the game, run the Play class. Once the set up is complete, it will display a (quite beautiful) chess board. 
Have fun!
